# Drowsiness_Detection_System

Drowsiness Detection is a project about developing a system of detecting if a person is feeling sleepy or drowsy during course of any action, he/she is performing and alerting about it to the respected person. This project is developed using Image Processing and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and the language used for development is Python.

Drowsiness detection aims to continuously detect if a person is drowsy or sleeping by continuously monitoring his facial movements, specially focusing on movements of eyes and mouth for yawning and alerting the person immediately if he is drowsy.

This system starts by taking live video input from a camera which is focussed on a person’s face. Then it continuously detects whether the person visible is sleeping or drowsy. It checks whether person’s eyes are open or close and also detects if person is yawning. If his eyes are found closed or yawning is detected it immediately alerts by playing an audio.
